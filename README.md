Hello there!! Welcome to my web site. Yes, this is another boring web site. I made it because I am a vain human who has little life out of computers. This page is about things that I like to do. Because this is a personal web site you may read a lot the word I. No, that doesn't mean that I am selfish. I really care about humanity and I help my neighbour. Now, if you are bored don't go on to read the rest of the site, you will be more bored
